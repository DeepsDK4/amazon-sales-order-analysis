This dataset contains a mix of text, numerical (float), and datetime values, which can be challenging to manage and analyze manually.

To address this complexity and extract valuable insights, I will use Python and its data analysis libraries in combination with Microsoft Excel. Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn will be utilized for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization. Microsoft Excel will be employed for additional data inspection and preliminary analysis.

By leveraging these tools, the goal is to uncover key trends, patterns, and insights from the sales data, which can inform business decisions and strategies.
